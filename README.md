# Node.js & MySQL

## Overview

This project is a combination of Node.js & MySQL. The user should first install the npm package by typing 'npm install' in the command line. Then the user can run the program by typing 'node bamazonCustomer.js' in the command line. Then through the inquirer package, the user is prompted to type in the item id number of the item they would like to buy and then the quantity. If the SQL database does not have enough inventory, the user will be alerted that the order has not gone through. If there is adequate inventory, the database will be updated and the user will be alerted of their total cost.
